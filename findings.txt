The Ips shown don't seem to be the same as the hosts.
Available disk space is shared with the host. Docker of course has the volumes feature if you wan to change this.
The containers have their own isolated processes, which is very much one of the selling points of containerization in the first place.
The containers seem to share the uptime with the docker engine.
