I used ChatGPT as google replacement for the following:

How do I get system info mentioned in the exercise with python and js? (This part mostly copy-pasted from there)
How to insert dependecies in containerized python apps?

Helped me save time by finding something that just worked instead of going through multiple stack overflow pages.
Didn't find mistakes in the parts of the output that I used.
